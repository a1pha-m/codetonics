    <h1>Good Bye Till We Meet Again...</h1>

    In every room of our time together there is a box Of memories we shared.<br/>
    Now is the time to pack away with sadness and care.<br/>
    <br/>
    The first is a simple smile, whenever I thought of you.<br/>
    Neatly folded into four, It's the best that I could do.<br/>
    <br/>
    Next are all the memories of the times when we were two,<br/>
    wrapped with love one by one, sealed with tears as glue.<br/>
    <br/>
    And then there are the Motu-Patlu the pigeons we had,<br/>
    Now in a cage of sadness and locked up with a tear.<br/>
    <br/>
    Next are the times we kissed, each one wrapped with a sigh,<br/>
    placed next to a rolled up list of all the times I've asked myself why.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now to pack are the pieces of my heart, gathered in a pile.<br/>
    Each one wrapped up tenderly and placed next to a distant smile.<br/>
    <br/>
    Finally all the shattered wishes, placed in softly so no more can break,<br/>
    covering them over trying not to cry so they would not all ache.<br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly walking round each room, closing each and every curtain,<br/>
    shutting each and every door, not leaving a single memory behind.<br/>
    <br/>
    Gathering up the memories we shared, making sure I've got them all,<br/>
    packing them softly because I cared, taking them with me in the.<br/>
    <br/>
    I hope that someday you will wake up and see there is nothing better than you and me.<br/>
    Until that time, I will always be near, wishing and waiting for your love to be here.<br/>
    <br/>
    It's time for me to leave, But I wish that I could wait.<br/>
    This has been dreaded for too long, and I'm not ready for this pain.<br/>
    <br/>
    It breaks my heart to know I may not see you ever again.<br/>
    These may be our last moments, and they may be coming to an end.<br/>
    <br/>
    You're all I ever wanted, the one thing I needed, the only one who could find the very best in me.<br/>
    I hope you'll always know, there is a special part saved up just for you right here in my heart.<br/>
