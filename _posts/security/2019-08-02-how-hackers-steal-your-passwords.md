Many web users assume that only expert hackers can crack their passwords. 
Contrary to that [common misconception](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/6-common-misconceptions-about-passwords/), 
most password cracking tools are available on the dark web, 
and any armature hacker can easily steal your password. 
If you want to safeguard yourself from such attacks, 
you should learn about the dangers of password hacks and secure your 
account the best way you can. In this guide, we highlight the common 
password cracking strategies and how you can prevent them.

### Dictionary Attack

Hackers often roll dictionary attacks first. 
It's the easiest password cracking technique that uses every word found 
in a dictionary. A computer program runs through all the words in a 
dictionary until the correct match is found. Hackers can process 
millions of words in a matter of minutes. As long as you use dictionary 
words in your password, it will be a matter of time before hackers get 
hold of your password.

### Hybrid Attack

Many web users believe that they can effectively secure their passwords 
by replacing letters with numbers or special characters. Unfortunately, 
hybrid attacks look through such sneaky ideas. A hybrid attack basically 
uses a combination of dictionary words and numbers preceding or following 
them. Passwords that use a dictionary word followed by a series of 
numbers, for example, "Rice2019" can be easily cracked through 
a hybrid attack.

### Rainbow Table Attack

A number of modern systems store passwords in a computer-generated 
numerical representation of digits, letters, and special characters, 
known as a hash. If a hacker gains access to a file with hashed passwords, 
they won't be able to read them. However, hashes can be cracked by 
employing a table for reversing hash functions. That table is called a 
rainbow table.

### Brute Force Attack

The brute force attack has nothing to do with being clever or subtle. 
The strategy&#39;s effectiveness and speed depend more on the 
computational power of the hacker. This attack utilizes every possible 
alpha-numeric combination, meaning that no password is totally safe. 
However, it takes a lot of time and resources, making it a preserve for 
professional hackers.

### Man-in-the-Middle Attack

Hackers can also use other strategies other than password cracking 
software. The man-in-the-middle attack is a typical and moderately simple 
attack that focuses on clients on open Wi-Fi systems. Hotspots in hotels 
or cafes are regularly decoded, giving anybody on a similar system a 
chance to keep an eye on your perusing data. The name 
&quot;man-in-the-middle&quot; originates from the fact that a hacker 
taps the traffic between your gadget and the server. Because of this smart 
move, the attacker can see each page you visit, messages you send, and 
login qualifications you input. On the off chance that you do your 
web-based shopping on an untrustworthy Wi-Fi network, your credit card 
information can be additionally stolen.

### Phishing

Through phishing, hackers can send you an email posing as a genuine 
institution or person you know and lure you into disclosing your 
sensitive information. In most cases, the email includes a link that 
redirects you to a website that is identical to the online banking 
platform you often visit. As you type in your login credentials, that 
information goes straight to the hacker.

### Hidden Malware

Hackers can also plant a virus on your device and get your login 
information. It could be in the form of fake software with keyloggers to 
record everything you type or even take screenshots of your login process. 
Some hackers may also smuggle malicious software into your device in the 
form of fitness apps or mobile games.

## How to Protect Yourself from Password Hacks

With hackers continuously trying all these techniques to crack your 
password, it can be overwhelming figuring out how to secure your password 
in this day and age. While it&#39;s not possible to protect your password 
100% from hackers, protecting your account shouldn&#39;t be an 
intimidating hassle. Here are some tips to help you out:

### Avoid Recycling Passwords

The worst mistake you can do is to use the same password on multiple 
accounts. When a hacker gets hold of your password, they will get a 
universal key to all your other accounts, which can be a security 
disaster. Hackers often 
[sell leaked password combinations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/07/24/deliveroo-accounts-hacked-and-sold-on-dark-web/) 
on the dark web at just a few dollars. It&#39;s based on the assumption 
that a single password can be used to access multiple accounts, 
including your credit card details.

### Utilize a Password Generator

Be sure to create a strong password that can only be cracked using a 
brute force attack. So, you must ditch all dictionary passwords and use 
completely random passwords. However, it can be difficult to manually 
generate a random password. The good news is that you can use an online 
password generator to generate strong, random passwords and store them 
securely.

### Use a Password Manager

Unique, random passwords are often difficult to remember, especially 
when you have to create a different one for every account. You need a 
password manager to keep your passwords and other sensitive data secure. 
You will only need to remember one master password to unlock all your 
other login credentials.

### Activate Two-factor Authentication

Since even the strongest passwords can still be hacked through phishing 
or man-in-the-middle attacks, it&#39;s important to turn on two-factor 
authentication. It&#39;s an extra layer of protection that combines your 
password with your phone or security key. Using a physical security key 
or an authentication app is recommended over 
[SMS authentication](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hey-stop-using-texts-two-factor-authentication/).

### Turn on VPN on Public Wi-Fi

Public hotspots are never safe for your sensitive data. Always use a VPN 
whenever you connect to open hotspots. VPNs will encrypt your internet 
traffic and safeguard your data even when connected to a public Wi-Fi 
network.

## Final Words

Passwords are still the most common security measure for online accounts. 
Your only option, for now, is to find a more secure way to maximize the 
effectiveness of your passwords. Since hackers constantly come up with 
new tricks to steal passwords, you need to regularly educate yourself on 
the latest threats and upgrade your defense mechanism accordingly.
