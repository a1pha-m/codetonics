A new year is here and with that our eagerness to make positive changes
in our life too.
The best way to do that is not making resolutions, but creating habits
that will stick for the long term.

If you want to run a marathon, form the habit of running.

If you want to write a book, form the habit of writing.

If you want to be more mindful, form the habit of meditation.

Of course, saying that is way easier than doing.

Here with this article, I am going to lay out key steps to form habits
that will change your life.


## Pick A Positive Habit

Instead of starting with quitting a bad habit, find a new positive habit
to form.
If you want to quit eating junk food, focus instead on creating the habit
of eating more vegetables.

## Do One At A Time
We all wants to make tons of positive changes which requires multiple habits
to change -- and all right now! But in my experience, the more habits you
do at once, the less likely your chances of success.
Trust me on this, doing one habit at a time is the best strategy by far.

## Take Small Steps
I have seen people underestimate the importance of this, but along with one
step at a time, this is probably the most important thing you need to do
to ensure success.
Start as small as you can and increase only gradually as long as you stay
consistent.
Eat a small serving of vegetables for one meal, don't try to change the
entire diet at once.

## Set Up Reminders
Don't let yourself forget! Set up visual reminders around where you want
to remember. The thing that trips people up in the starting is remembering
to do the habit.

## Find Rewards
You won't stick to any change for long if you hate doing it. Instead, find
some pleasure in doing the habit.
For example, if you go running, don't think of it as torture, but as a way
to enjoy outdoors, to feel alive.

## Consistency Is The Key
The more consistent you are, the better. Resist putting off the habit, and
make it your policy to just get started when you have said you will do it,
rather than indulging in the old pattern of procrastination.

## Review, Adjust, Adapt
Review how you did with your habits at the end of day/week and adjust as needed.
If you forget to do the habit, adjust by creating new reminder.
If you fall down, keep coming back.

Let's start this year with a bang.
