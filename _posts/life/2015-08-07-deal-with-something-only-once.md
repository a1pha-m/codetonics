I find myself consciously procrastinating more than I would like. I'll read some email, some GitHub issue or pull request 
and think "I will come back to this later. I'd rather just code". 
Over time the items on my mental to-do list start to build up until I have a decreasing hope of ever getting them complete.
You see, to-do lists are like a burrito. If you fill it with too many things it falls apart and then you cry and they kick you out of Chipotle.

> **If a task can be done in less than two minutes, do it right away.**

Few weeks back, I've started trying to change that.
Rather than saying **"later"**, if I really mean to get back to something, I'll deal with it right away.
Even if it means the reply or review is shorter, at least the task gets pushed on a little and I'm not a bottleneck for progress.
I want to start dealing with things immediately.

There's this story I recently read about **Susan O'Connell - a Zen Master** who's taught the **"deal with it only once"** principle.

> **The idea is that you should deal with something only once. Do it now. Once done, it's off your mind and you can fully focus on the next matter at hand.**

There isn't really any science behind this. A lot of us will say, "I can decide on that or reply to that later" to many 
of the tasks we end up each day, but we put them aside for later. Avoid putting off those small decisions so they don't weigh at the back of your mind.

If you read an email, write a quick reply to it right away. Don't let it sit there. Add thoughts, even if brief, to ongoing pull requests.
Schedule those meetings you really want to get into your calendar.

> **Take actions, move onto the next thing, rinse and repeat.**
