It has been said, better late then never.

**The Pragmatic Programmer** is a book that almost every software engineer
seems to recommend to each other, and dutifully so!

Well, I just started reading it after getting too many recommendation.

With this blog post I have tried summarize some of the key ideas from the
book, but I recommend it to read it yourself the thoughts about how to write
code in the real world in 320 dense pages.


## Its all about your mindset
Initial few chapters talk about philosophy, psychology and approaches to
coding instead of actual code.

Before you can write beautiful code, you need to be thinking clearly, have
clear expectations, and get buy-in from the people around you.
