title: Hello World! Shifted to Github Pages

I always loved Wordpress as a blogging platform because of its flexibility.
But it was way too complex for the kind of blog I wanted i.e. a simple blog where I can share my thoughts and nothing else.
Here I am after shifting my blog to Github pages.

## Reasons

The main benefit of GitHub Pages is ease of collaboration. Changes you make in the repository are automatically synced, so if your site's hosted on GitHub, it's as up-to-date as your GitHub repository. This really appeals to me because when I just want to quickly get something set up, I don't want to mess around with hosting; and when people submit a pull request, I want that change to be visible as soon as I merge it without having to set up web hooks.

The process of backing up Wordpress is a huge pain. I was annoyed constantly installing security updates. I hated having to keep an opaque database in order to keep all of my content. And whenever I went in to edit my website, I was always afraid that I would fat-finger change something and have no idea what happened.

Finally, Jekyll is very lightweight and allows for very minimal websites without any bloat.
