> Your tiny type is hard to read - no, not hard to read, impossible to read.

I don't know why people still set **12px** as body font-size. Your users are not here to give an eye exam. There is a reason why all the major browser set font-size to **16px by default**.

>Why would we limit the effectiveness of body text by minimizing its size to a browser-default thatâ€™s now over 20 years old, even on large displays?

Don't expect your users to carry a magnifying glass with them everywhere.

Well there is a Reading Mode button in few mobile browsers, but that's not a solution to the problem. That's more like a band-aid for the bad typesetting. **Don't forget it is not available on all major browsers.**

Most of the time when I'm on my computer, and reader mode doesn't exists. I hit ```Ctrl+``` few times so that my dyslexic brain can make sense of the musty **12px fonts** your servers regurgitated all over my screen. Then the layout falls apart. Words start smashing together. And I find myself scrolling up, down, left, right, left, right - what in the hell is this?
Of course I know zoom is a mandatory feature in almost every browser, but that doesn't prevent breaking the layout in unexpected ways unless developed with good responsive practices.

How many times have you have heard users complain about fonts being too small? More times than you've heard them complain about fonts being too large - wait, you've never heard a user complain about that. Your users are struggling to read your content. Surely that isn't what you're going for, and surely that isn't a good experience.
