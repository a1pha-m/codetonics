> Your tiny type is hard to read - no, not hard to read, impossible to read.

I don't know why people still set 12px as body font-size. Your users are not here to give an eye exam. 
There is a reason why all the major browser set font-size to 16px by default.

Don't expect your users to carry a magnifying glass with them everywhere.
 
Well there is a Reading Mode button in few mobile browsers, but that's not a solution to the problem. That's more like a 
band-aid for the bad typesetting.

Most of the time I'm on my computer, and reader mode doesn't exists. I hit ```Ctrl+``` few times so that my 
dyslexic brain can make sense of the musty 12px fonts your servers regurgitated all over my screen. Then the 
layout falls apart. Words start smashing together. And I find myself scrolling up, down, left, right, left, right - what 
in the hell is this? 

How many times have you have heard users complain about fonts being too small? More times than you've heard them complain 
about fonts being too large - wait, you've never heard a user complain about that. Your users are struggling to read 
your content. Surely that isn't what you're going for, and surely that isn't a good experience.
