The dream is to create a **"wow"** experience on the first visit of your website or app.

> **The very first user experience is like being on a first date.**

Think about being on a first date with someone and that someone starts picking their nose in the beginning of the dinner, 
well there won't be second date. 
But if you have been married to that someone for years and they start digging for gold, you won't immediately divorce them right away.
There is something different once the relationship is already established.

> **People make snap judgement.**

It takes less than a second to form a first impression.
That first impression form an opinion that determine whether they like it or not, whether they will stay or leave.

The first impression is an unconscious event where our mind tries to categorize and generate feelings depending on 
different social attributes, such as trustworthiness or dominance. These feelings instantly impact our own body language and behaviour.

If the first experience with is positive, The visitor is more likely to not only spend more time but also explore more.
And the more time he spends, the more likely he is to become engaged.

## Things impact the first impression

These are few things which drastically affect the first impression of a visitor.
Some applies to websites, some applies to apps and some applies to both. 

### Speed

The first impression is built after the website or app loads.
People are becoming more and more impatient these days. If it take more than 2 seconds to load, they become annoyed and most likely to navigate away.

A [research on page load time by Kissmetrics](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/) says:

1. 40% of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.
2. 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less.
3. A 1 second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions.

### Design

> **First impressions are 94% design related.**
 
Beauty grabs more attention.
Clearly the look and feel of the website is the main driver of first impressions.

Poor design is particularly associated with rapid rejection and mistrust.
When one does not like some aspect of the design, the whole website or app is often not explored further than the landing page and is not considered suitable.

### Complexity

> **Confusion kills conversions!**

One of the most important qualities of a website optimized for high conversion rates is simplicity.
Eliminate clutter and avoid confusing design at all costs. 

It must be obvious what you want him to do, and what you are offering him.
 
### Prototypicality or Familiarity

Prototypicality means how representative a design looks for a certain category of websites or app.
It is important to follow conventions. People have a fixed idea what an app or website should be like.
If you go for innovative, unconventional layouts â€“ people are less likely to like them.

 
### And a Winning Smile!
    
As the saying goes, **"Smile and the world smiles too."** So there's nothing like a smile on user's face to create a good first impression.


## Conclusion

Visual appeal matters a lot. Don't **ever** try to save money on design.
