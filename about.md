I'm Jayesh Panchal.

I was born in **[Banswara (India)](http://banswara.rajasthan.gov.in/)** sometime in the early half of the **1990s** and 
have been blessed with loving parents and one younger sister.

I attended **[The Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda](http://www.msubaroda.ac.in)** where I completed my 
*graduation(BCA)* as well as *post graduation in computer applications(MCA)*.

I work at **[Zeus Learning, Mumbai](http://www.zeuslearning.com)**, and absolutely love what I do (writing tons of code).

Most of the time when I am not writing code, I spend thinking about the **design** of various things. The experience user 
will have. The usability of particular design etc.

My love for **bikes** is known to almost everyone in my life.

I started this blog because of my love for writing. Especially so for things that I like. This site is a resource - for 
myself and the community. It's also my personal design and code playground, a place to experiment, and therefore, a site 
that is often in a state of flux.

If you're feeling up to it, tweet me on **[Twitter](http://twitter.com/codetonics)**.
