I'm Jayesh Panchal.

I was born in **[Banswara (India)](https://banswara.rajasthan.gov.in/)** sometime in the early half of the **1990s** and have been blessed with loving parents and one younger sister.

I attended **[The Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda](https://www.msubaroda.ac.in)** where I completed my  *graduation(BCA)* as well as *post graduation in computer applications(MCA)*.

I currently work for **[Remitr](https://remitr.com)**

Previously, I worked at:

1. **[Yapsody](https://yapsody.com/)**

2. **[Fork Media](https://getforked.in/)**

3. **[Zeus Learning, Mumbai](https://www.zeuslearning.com)**

Most of the time when I am not writing code, I spend thinking about the **design** of various things. The experience user will have. The usability of particular design etc.

My love for **bikes** and **cars** is known to almost everyone in my life.

I started this blog because of my love for writing. Especially so for things that I like. This site is a resource - for myself and the community. It's also my personal design and code playground, a place to experiment, and therefore, a site that is often in a state of flux.

If you're feeling up to it, tweet me on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/codetonics)** or follow me on **[Instagram](https://instagram.com/a1pha_m)**.
